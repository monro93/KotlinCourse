# Course of Kotlin for Java developers

I've created this course for people that knows already Java or another OOP and wants to learn Kotlin. I would say this course is not for people who do not program yet, if that is your case I embrace you to take the official [Kotlinlang course](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world).
Is based on examples of Java and Kotlin to make easier the transaction, but I explain all the concepts anyway in case you don't know Java or you know only the basics.

## Lessons
* [01 - Variables and Classes](./theory/Lesson01.md)
* [02 - Conditionals, Loops And Nulls](./theory/Lesson02.md)
