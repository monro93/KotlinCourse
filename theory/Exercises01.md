# Exercises 01 - Variables and Classes

## E1
Convert the classes that are in the [e1 package](../src/main/java/org/example/kotlinWorkshop/java/exercises01/e1) to kotlin in the following package:  [this package](../src/main/kotlin/org/example/kotlinWorkshop/kotlin/exercises01/e1). Do not use the ide auto-convert. Once they are migrated, remove the imports in this file  [Main.kt](../src/main/kotlin/org/example/kotlinWorkshop/kotlin/exercises01/e1/Main.kt) and ensure that the code works

## E2
Create the following classes in Kotlin in [this package](../src/main/kotlin/org/example/kotlinWorkshop/kotlin/exercises01/e2): 
* Country - Enum with the values ES, AR, TR, SA
* Name - With the parameters firstName String, lastName String and secondLastName String optional
* Person - abstract with a Name and an abstract method called `greet` that will return a String
* Employee - extends from Person with E2Country. Not abstract. When it greets, should say its full name
* Developer - extends from Employee with programming language as String. when it greet should say its full name and their favorite language

Once they are created, uncomment the file [Main.kt](../src/main/kotlin/org/example/kotlinWorkshop/kotlin/exercises01/e2/Main.kt) and  finish the code adding yourself to make it work.
